# LabWedsite
My CS project, need to build a website (including front end and back end) for lab to display our research result, this repo is just for develop conveniently, after finishing all of it, I will paste a link directly to website on our NAS server.  
I will not upload any imgs and videos, if you want to see how it works, just goto our website directly  
Use python flask, MySQL and JQuery. Run in Docker
